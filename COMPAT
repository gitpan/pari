This file lists the incompatible changes between Version 1.39.15 and 2.0.x

* The calculator GP:
====================
 - most function names have changed (see misc/new.dic or use whatnow under GP)
 - lowercase / uppercase letters distinguished.
 - the syntax \var = value is not recognized anymore. Use standard
   metacommands instead.
(setting the compatibility level "compatible" to 3, with "default" will give
you those three back).

 - strict parenthesis matching before executing the command
(set strictmatch to 0 to get old behaviour)

 - functions label / goto have been removed (use break/next/return instead).
 - conjugation x_ has been removed. '_' can be freely used in identifiers.
 - \k metacommand removed

 - result history is now cyclic (older results are erased when the maximal
   size "histsize" is reached).
 - the Set() function turns objects into strings (so that set functions are
   able to treat arbitrary objects). Use eval to turn them back to GENs.
 - the type() function returns a string and not a number.
 - sum(X=a,b,...,x) yields x if b<a. Analogous statement for prod.

* The library PARI:
===================
 - use symbolic type names (t_INT, etc.). Don't use any explicit type number
   in your programs since these are liable to change (they have not, but will).
 - the codewords of GEN objects have a different internal structure. The
   components should only be accessed through the documented macros. When
   creating codeword x[1] for the GEN x, use the eval* macros (the set* ones
   don't fill the codeword completely).
 - the following constant names have changed ("pari" prepended): C1, C2, C3, K,
   K1, K2, K4. The constant C31 has disappeared.
 - prec and defaultpadicprecision are no longer global. The latter has
   disapeared.
 - char *pariversion not set anymore (use the macros PARIVERSION/PARIINFO)
 - LONG_IS_32BIT is never defined (test whether LONG_IS_64BIT is defined
   or not).
 - gen2str() renamed to GENtostr().
 - gitoascii() suppressed, use GENtostr().
 - init() renamed to pari_init().
 - the macro mant() has been suppressed.
 - imprimer() suppressed. output() is now a function and can be used under
   all debuggers.
 - the prototypes and behaviour of gredsp() and normalize() have changed.
   They are not documented anymore.
 - the install() function has been modified (use codes instead of valence).
 - gpuigs only has two arguments.
 - integ now takes two arguments, like deriv.
 - setrand, getrand, getstack, gettime, glength return a C long, and not a GEN.
 - pari_randseed no longer global, use setrand/getrand
 - gerepile(ltop,lbot,0) no longer returns ltop - lbot
 - nf[5][7] stored in two element form (was Z-basis) for faster inversion
 - t_POL and t_POLMOD can be freely mixed as long as main variables are the
   same (result is the expected POLMOD)
